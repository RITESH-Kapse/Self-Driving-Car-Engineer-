Doubt:
Need more detail on

1. 
# Find the region inside the lines
XX, YY = np.meshgrid(np.arange(0, xsize), np.arange(0, ysize))
region_thresholds = (YY > (XX*fit_left[0] + fit_left[1])) & \
                    (YY > (XX*fit_right[0] + fit_right[1])) & \
                    (YY < (XX*fit_bottom[0] + fit_bottom[1]))
					
especially meshgrid and code for region_thresholds.

2. What is use of ~ operator and how it works. E.g.
	
		# Mask color and region selection
		color_select[color_thresholds | ~region_thresholds] = [0, 0, 0]
		# Color pixels red where both color and region selections met
		line_image[~color_thresholds & region_thresholds] = [255, 0, 0]
