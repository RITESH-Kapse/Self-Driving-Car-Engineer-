## Advanced Lane Finding

Steps to run the project code :

Just open the file 'ProjectVideoCode.ipynb' and execute the code blocks one after the other. Once pipeline will get executed,
the output video output is created.

"project_video.mp4" is input to pipeline under the file "ProjectVideoCode.ipynb" and "project_video_output.mp4" is the output for same.
"challenge_video.mp4" is input to pipeline under the file "ChallengeVideoCode.ipynb" and "challenge_video_output.mp4" is the output for same.

Also for detailed explanation of code with each step implementation study / code and analyis , please refer "writeup.pdf" document.
