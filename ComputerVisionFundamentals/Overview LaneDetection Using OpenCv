For lane detection on a video, we have to pass some steps that you can see below:

	Getting each frame from video
	Making grayscale each frame
	Detecting edges by using Canny Algorithm
	Finding Lane by using Hough Algorithm
	Improving output and making a new video as a result
	
	Gaussian smoothing and Canny Edge Detection to optimize for detecting the lane lines
